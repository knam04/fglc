          <h1>A Space for FGLI Prelaw Students</h1>
          <p>Welcome to the Rice First-Generation Legal Collective! We are an organization on campus focused on advancing accessibility and diversity in the legal profession through targeted resources, mentorship, and support that address the financial and structural barriers underrepresented pre-law students face. Our organization is intended to be a space for pre-law first-generation college students; limited-income students, and working-class students at Rice University. Our purpose is to be a space for students of these backgrounds to share and affirm our experiences, advocate for our communities, and support our career aspirations.</p>

                <h3>Accessing Resources</h3>
                <p>   We hope our website database and the knowledge of our group members will provide an invaluable resource for prelaw students. The prelaw process is confusing to navigate especially without knowledge of what resources exist to help out. Our resource page serves as a repository of useful scholarships, LSAT prep resources, pipeline programs, etc.</p>
